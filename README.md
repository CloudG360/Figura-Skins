# My Figura Skins

_See [Figura Mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/figura) to use these skins in-game._

Here's a repository storing all the skins I've made/modified for the figura mod!


### Index:

#### Religion (Village Church):

A recreation of a pre-1.14 village church modelled by myself in blockbench! It's far under the file size limit, however, it may require players to increase their complexity limit in order for it to be seen.

Oh and don't forget to upload the skin! The button is hidden under the preview. :)


#### Hubble (Hiccup):

A skin made by a friend which depicts hiccup's wingsuit from How To Train Your Dragon 2. I added the code and model for the wings which appear when flying, however, at the current point in time it is not possible to hide the elytra with the mod. A texture pack must be used to remove the elytra wings.

The wing-suit angles and behaviour have a few configuration variables at the top of the `script.lua`
